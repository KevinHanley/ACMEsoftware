                        1. To create a new task you must first navigate to "Tasks" within the menu strip.

                        2. Then select "Create Task".
                        </br>
                        3. A new task requires a heading (to give an overview of the task), detailed description, due date, task proirity (how urgently does it need to be done) and a member of staff to be assigned to it.

                        <br>
                        3. You are unable to assign tasks to staff outside your project team because the tasks aren't relevant to them.
                </p>

                        </br>
                        4. This list box displays the task headings. Select a heading to view and the boxes on the right will be populated.
                        </br>
                        5. Here may also change the status of the task or provide a query if you need more information on how to complete the task.
                </p>
                
                </br>

                        2. If you require help completing a task or need more information about it then submit a query so senior staff can view it.
                        </br> 
                        3. You are able to submit multple queries from each task, simply by re-opening it within the "My Tasks" option of the menu strip.
                </p>

                        1. Yes!
                        </br>
                        2. If you navigate to "Tasks" -> "View Tasks" -> "All", then you see several options.
                        </br> 
                        3. "By Project" allows you to view all tasks that currently exist for your project. That means every task, regardless of who it is assigned to, will be viewable.
                        </br>
                        4. "By Staff Member" allows you to see every task that is assigned to each person, within your project team.
                        </br>
                        These options are useful if you want to assign a task to somebody. <b>We recommend</b> you assign tasks to those who currently have the fewest task assigned to them.
                        </br>
                        5. Again you are only able to view staff/tasks that are on the same project as you. You cannot view every staff or every task in the system.

                        </br> 
                        3. Any task that is "unassigned will appear in "Filtered" -> "Unassigned". Here you will be able to assign tasks to ther or chose a task for yourself.
                        </br>
                        4. Any task that is "Ongoing" means that it is assigned and being worked on.
                        </br>
                        5. A task that is finshed will appear in the "Completed" section once the assigned user updates it.

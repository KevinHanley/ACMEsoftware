                <h2 id="q1">1. How does our staff structre work? <i class="material-icons">arrow_downward</i></h2>
                <p id="q1a" class="answer">
                        1. At ACME Software use a very straight forward system of hierarchy.
                        </br>
                        2. At the top is the Senior Manager. They control all financial aspects of the company and report to shareholders. They can also be the lead of a project.
                        </br>
                        3. Beneath the Senoir Manager are Team Leaders. These are senior staff who are each in charge of a project and report all project progress to the senoir manager. They each have several employees who report to them as well.
                </p>
                
                </br>
                
                <h2 id="q2">2. Which staff are allowed to make tasks? <i class="material-icons">arrow_downward</i></h2>
                <p id="q2a" class="answer">
                        1. All staff members are allowed to create tasks, but only tasks that relate to their specific project.
                </p>
                
                </br>
                
                <h2 id="q3">3. I see a few options that are disabled. What does this mean? <i class="material-icons">arrow_downward</i></h2>
                <p id="q3a" class="answer">
                        1. Not all employee have access to the same privilages within our Task Management System.
                        </br>
                        2. Only Team Leaders and the Senior Manager are allowed to add new employees to the system for example.
                </p>
                    
                </br>
                
                <h2 id="q4">4. Can I adjust my personal details in "Staff Adjustemts"? <i class="material-icons">arrow_downward</i></h2>
                <p id="q4a" class="answer">
                        1. No. Only Team Leaders and the Senior Manager are able to access employee data.
                        </br>
                        2. This option in the menu strip is primary used to re-assign staff to different roles where need
                        </br> 
                        3. To change project send a request email to your team leader. You must have at least two valid reasons to change project.
                </p>
                    
                </br>
                            
                            
                <h2 id="q5">5. NEED HERE <i class="material-icons">arrow_downward</i></h2>
                <p id="q5a" class="answer">
                        1. Yes!
                        </br>
                        2. If you navigate to "Tasks" -> "View Tasks" -> "All", then you see several options.
                        </br> 
                        3. "By Project" allows you to view all tasks that currently exist for your project. That means every task, regardless of who it is assigned to, will be viewable.
                        </br>
                        4. "By Staff Member" allows you to see every task that is assigned to each person, within your project team.
                        </br>
                        These options are useful if you want to assign a task to somebody. <b>We recommend</b> you assign tasks to those who currently have the fewest task assigned to them.
                        </br>
                        5. Again you are only able to view staff/tasks that are on the same project as you. You cannot view every staff or every task in the system.
                </p>

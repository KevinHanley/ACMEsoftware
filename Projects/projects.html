                        1. Only the senior manager can create new projects.
                        </br>
                        2. When they create the project they will assign a Team Leader to co-ordinate it.
                        <br>
                        3. The Team Leader or Senior Manager can then assign staff to work on the project.
                </p>
                
                </br>

                        </br>
                        2. Here you have the option to view the status of previous projects or ongoing projects.
                        </br>
                        3. You will be greeted by a screen which lists all your current tasks with the listbox on the left.
                </p>
                
                </br>
                
                <h2 id="q4">4. NEED HERE <i class="material-icons">arrow_downward</i></h2>
                <p id="q4a" class="answer">
                        1. A task query allows all developers to engage with other staff.
                        </br>
                        2. If you require help completing a task or need more information about it then submit a query so senior staff can view it.
                        </br> 
                        3. You are able to submit multple queries from each task, simply by re-opening it within the "My Tasks" option of the menu strip.
                </p>
                    
                </br>

                        1. Yes!
                        </br>
                        2. If you navigate to "Tasks" -> "View Tasks" -> "All", then you see several options.
                        </br> 
                        3. "By Project" allows you to view all tasks that currently exist for your project. That means every task, regardless of who it is assigned to, will be viewable.
                        </br>
                        4. "By Staff Member" allows you to see every task that is assigned to each person, within your project team.
                        </br>
                        These options are useful if you want to assign a task to somebody. <b>We recommend</b> you assign tasks to those who currently have the fewest task assigned to them.
                        </br>
                        5. Again you are only able to view staff/tasks that are on the same project as you. You cannot view every staff or every task in the system.
                </p>
                
                </br>

                        5. A task that is finshed will appear in the "Completed" section once the assigned user updates it.
